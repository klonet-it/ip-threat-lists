# 🛡️ Public IP Blacklists 

This repository provides a curated and automatically updated set of IP blacklists from well-known public sources.

The goal is to simplify access to threat intelligence data for use in:

- Firewalls  
- Intrusion detection/prevention systems  
- Abuse detection tools  
- Security enrichment pipelines  

All files are updated hourly via scheduled GitHub Actions and are generated from a private aggregator repository.
